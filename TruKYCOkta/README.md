## TruKYC Okta Integration App

### Prerequisites

#### Admin Prerequisites
1. Add a Native OIDC app with the proper scopes:  
   `okta.authenticators.manage.self`, `okta.authenticators.read`, `okta.devices.manage`, `okta.devices.read`,  
   `okta.factors.manage`, `okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.maintenance.manage`, `okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.maintenance.read`,  
   `okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.manage`, `okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.read`, `okta.users.manage`, `okta.users.read.self`.

2. Create an **APNS config** at [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com).  
   The Bundle ID should match this appâ€™s bundle ID (`com.yella.TruKYCOkta`).  
   Download the `.p8` APNS key for use during Okta setup.

3. Create a custom authenticator in Okta using the APNS configuration created above.

#### Client Prerequisites
1. If your client app is **Xcode-managed**, add the following capabilities to the app target under `Signing & Capabilities`:
   - App Groups
   - Push Notifications
   - Time Sensitive Notifications

   If not, create a new App ID in the Apple Developer portal with these capabilities enabled.

2. Install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) if not already installed.

## Update Okta.plist

This SDK needs an access token for backend authentication. We're using [Okta Mobile SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift) for sign-in and token retrieval.

Update the `Okta.plist` file with your Okta appâ€™s values:
1. `{clientId}` â€“ OIDC Client ID
2. `{issuer}` â€“ Appâ€™s OAuth2 domain (e.g. `https://yourdomain.okta.com`)
3. `{redirectUri}` â€“ Must match what's configured in your app
4. `{logoutRedirectUri}` â€“ Must match whatâ€™s configured in your app
5. `{scopes}` â€“ Include:
   - `openid`
   - `offline_access`
   - `profile`
   - `email`
   - `okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.manage`
   - `okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.read`

---

## Run the Project

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd TruKYCOkta/
    ```

2. Update and install pods:
    ```bash
    pod repo update
    pod install
    ```

3. Open the `.xcworkspace` file:
    ```bash
    open TruKYCOkta.xcworkspace
    ```

4. In Xcode, update the Bundle Identifier in project settings to match your Apple Developer App ID.

5. Under `Signing & Capabilities`, add your App Group (e.g. `group.group.com.yella.TruKYCOkta`).  
   If it differs from the default, update the `applicationGroupID` in `AppDelegate.swift`.

6. Build and run on a **real device** ðŸ“² for Push Notifications & Camera access.

---

## Enroll the App as a Custom Authenticator

Sign in using your Okta org credentials in the app. Then:

1. Enable **Sign in with Push Notification**.  
   This will trigger SDK enrollment and register your device as a push authenticator.

2. On success, youâ€™ll see a success alert confirming enrollment.

---

## Verify It Works

1. On a browser, sign in to your Okta org.
2. After password entry, you should receive a push notification.
3. Tap the notification to launch the app and complete verification via the TruKYC SDK.
4. If successful, youâ€™ll be signed in.

---

### Push Delivery Issues

If notifications fail to arrive, the SDK will poll for pending challenges when the app is foregrounded.  
If thereâ€™s one pending, the app will prompt you for verification.

---

## Implementing the SDK in Your Project

1. **`NSCameraUsageDescription`**

    Add this key to your appâ€™s `Info.plist` to enable camera access:
    ```xml
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Used for facial identity verification via TruKYC</string>
    ```

    If missing, the app will **crash at runtime** when attempting to access the camera.

2. **`apsEnvironment`**

    Ensure your app uses the correct push notification environment.

    - In `Entitlements.plist`, add:
      ```xml
      <key>aps-environment</key>
      <string>development</string>
      ```

      Replace with `production` for production builds.

3. **Age Verification Check**

    In `TruKYCHandler.swift`, the following logic checks that the user is over 21:
    ```swift
    if result.isSelfieReal && result.isUserAbove21 {
        // Proceed
    }
    ```

    To allow users under 21 with valid IDs, use:
    ```swift
    if result.isSelfieReal && (result.isUserAbove21 || result.isUserBelow21) {
        // Proceed
    }
    ```

---

## Debugging Tips

1. **Push Not Received**

    - Use the [Apple APNs Console](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/push) to send test pushes.
    - Ensure the push targets the correct bundle ID.

2. **Unable to Sign In After Username Entry**

    - Ensure the device is already enrolled via this TruKYC Okta app.
    - Otherwise, sign-in wonâ€™t proceed to password or verification steps.

3. **Check Enrollment Status**

    - In the Okta Admin Console, go to **System Logs**.
    - Successful enrollments show `Authentication of user via MFA SUCCESS`.
    - Deleted enrollments show `Reset factor for user SUCCESS`.
